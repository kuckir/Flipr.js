# Flipr.js
JavaScript library for making flipping books.

I made [Flipr.js](http://flipr.ivank.net/) in 2012 with commercial intentions :) 
It did not go as I expected, so I am publishing it here as open-source under MIT.

Flipr.js uses [IvanK.js](http://lib.ivank.net) to render graphics with WebGL. 
Animations should be crisp and smooth on any device.
